# KevPack

At the moment only includes a marker + trail pack for Magic Mirrors in Castora.  
  
~~This pack does not make use of relogging to reset mirrors to gain bonus keys.~~   
The key economy after the nerf is pretty bad, making it a way better strat to reload.  
I have kept the reloading amount minimal, so it's only twice per map!
It provides a trail to every mirror and chest on Castora, with instructions on when and where to get more keys when you run out.  

The pack makes use of information windows provided by the BlishHUD Pathing module for instructions.  
Please make sure to enable the following settings for optimal usage of the pack:
